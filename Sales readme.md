# 

# 📌 BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

# 

# The dashboard answers key business questions:

# 

# What is the total sales and profit performance?

# 

# Which products generate the highest revenue?

# 

# Which regions perform best?

# 

# How do sales trends change over time?

# 

# How does actual sales compare to budget?

# 

# Which products contribute most to profit?

# 

# 🔎 KEY BUSINESS INSIGHTS

# 

# (Replace with your real numbers from dashboard)

# 

# 20% of products generate the majority of total revenue (Pareto trend)

# 

# Q4 consistently shows peak sales performance

# 

# North America generates highest revenue but lower margin compared to Europe

# 

# Some product categories underperform against budget targets

# 

# Profit margin fluctuates significantly across regions

# 

# This analysis helps management focus on high-performing segments and improve underperforming areas.

# 

# 🧹 DATA CLEANING USING T-SQL

# 

# Data transformation techniques applied:

# 

# LEFT JOIN

# 

# WHERE clause filtering

# 

# ORDER BY

# 

# CASE() function

# 

# ISNULL() function

# 

# Derived columns

#

# 

# A proper Star Schema relationship model was implemented.

# 

# 📊 DATA MODELING IN POWER BI

# 

# Established relationships between Fact \& Dimension tables

# 

# Imported Budget table

# 

# Created a dedicated Measure Table

# 

# Implemented calculated columns and measures

#
